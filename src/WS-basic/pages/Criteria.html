                                    This year, NYMU-Taipei tries to capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In daily life, we
                                    are often exposed to many viruses; however, passively prevent it with mask is not
                                    enough. Our goal is to actively destroy the virus, which more efficiently provide
                                    every-day protection against this outraging pandemic. As a result, we try to make
                                    protease by ourselves, which could detroy spikes, and make ACE2, which could capture
                                    spike protein. To sum up,“Catch and destroy SARS COV2” is our goal. Further
                                    information could be found in our description page on wiki.

                                    To capture and inactivate SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the destroy of the spike proteins
                                    on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we’ve created a protease database searching software aiming to
                                    find the best protease for SARS COV2. As decribed, this database is not only for
                                    SARS-CoV-2, but could also be used on other viruses as well, when there is another
                                    virus outbreak, we could find the relative protease more efficiently. Besides, we
                                    invented a 3D printed detection box which is portable and can attain fast virus
                                    detection, instead of using PCR. This way, we could help the government to have the
                                    primary screening at the airport. For more info, please check out our dry lab and

                                We’ve contructed fusion proteins for the capture and inactivation of COVID-19. First, we
                                search for the protease which could interact with spike protein without detroy human
                                body. Than we try to clone the sequence through PCR and GIBSON; however, it is hard to
                                get the small fragment from the bacteria genomic DNA. We had tried to PCR several times
                                from genomic DNA, but couldn’t get the result. After that, we rechoose our protease and
                                buying the genomic DNA extraction kit. Eventually, we successfully clone the sequence
                                and recobind it on our vector. See our engineering page for detailed information.

                                product, we learned that our product should be convenient. Moreover, receiving advice
                                from professors, our team was able to have more variety in the design. Last but not
                                least, through our discussion with both companies, our team learned that it’s not easy
                                for a product to go from production to the market. In conclusion, after approaching with
                                them, we learned well on improving our project, which can benefit the whole worlds. For

                                This year, our modeling focuses on finding the bnding site, we use protein docking and
                                find the affinity. It is an extremely important part to our project because it helps us
                                accurately check and predict the proein-protein interaction due to the limitation of
                                wet. In our project, there are two essential parts, we try to use modeling to prove our
                                hypothesis is correct. First, ACE2 would catch spike protein. Second, protease(pepP) can
                                detroy the spike. For more information, please visit our Modeling page.

                                In our experiment, we made a construct which contains Red Fluorescent Protein with his
                                tag on C terminal. we do this to test our gel covered with Cu2+ that can capture his
                                tag. With rfp, we can immediately check whether it binds on the gel with naked eye.

                                Our detection box is a high possible device use in real world. Firstly, since it is
                                small, it can be made through 3D printing, make it costless and convenient. From the wet
                                lab experiment, we could conclude our gel with ACE2 can actually catch the spike of the
                                virus and make it visualized. Sencondly, since it is a simple concept of capture and
                                fluorescent, we are able to detect the virus in breath quickly.
