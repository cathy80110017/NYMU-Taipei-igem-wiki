                                In order to find the reasonable protease to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
                                while remmaining unharmful to the hACE2 protein. We developed a program that
                                combines the strengths of web scraping and regex sequence matching in order to
                                derive a satisfying choice for our wet lab experiments. Though, our wet lab results
                                are not 100% definite, we are sure that this software can be helpful to anyone who
                                is trying to find adept proteases for certain experiments.

                                By making the most out of easy to implement python packages, we are able to
                                implement a python program that crawls data from the MEROPS website, which is the
                                main protease databank worldwide right now. MEROPS collects findings from different
                                researches and organizes them into a structured form, where all the cleavage sites
                                of a protease that were proved to happen were listed down. Therefore, we crawled and
                                parsed the data to store them all in a .csv file where we only store the information
                                we need, which includes the MEROPs ID of the protease, the name of the protease, and
                                the 8 amino acid cut site sequences of that particular protease. We store the data
                                for later sequence matching which will be introduced in the next section.

                                Here, in view of speeding up the process of sequence matching where speed is of much
                                importance. We decided to develop the program using C++. Our program starts by
                                requiring the user to pass in two .fasta sequences as arguments, and then it
                                searches through the merops database that is crawled from the internet in the
                                previous section. At last, it outputs all the protease that cut and their cut sites
                                on the two proteins respectively. On the other hand, it also stores the proteases
                                that cut only one of the two sequences which is what most users are looking for just
                                like in our case. Therefore, by implementing it this way, our program becomes more
                                versatile and portable. It can deal with different sequences using different
                                protease databases(they need to be stored in the same format however), making it a
                                ever more powerful tool for future iGEM teams or anybody who is interested in
                                protein structure-related investigations.
