                                    throughout the world via the tightly connected global economy. By the end of 2019,

                                    The prevalence of COVID-19 as we mentioned above is mainly due in part to its
                                    transmission
                                    mechanics.
                                    However, COVID-19 is a novel disease and many of its transmission mechanics still
                                    derserves more
                                    understanding.
                                    The major route of transmission of the virus is through
                                    person-to-person close
                                    interactions. The main source of infection is through airborne measures, such as
                                    respiratory
                                    droplets
                                    and aerosols, the former is more infectious but drops to the ground more easily,
                                    while the
                                    latter is
                                    less infectious but stays longer in indoor settings. Infections through fecal-oral
                                    routes or
                                    contaminated surfaces are also possible but less common.

                                    COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system, including the upper respiratory
                                    tract (sinuses,
                                    nose,

                                    (M), envelop
                                    (E),
                                    nucleocapsid (N), of which Spike is the main focus of our project studies. Spike is
                                    composed of
                                    a

                                    of coronaviruses and host tropism. Spike consists of two functional subunits. S1
                                    subunit is
                                    responsible
                                    for binding to the host receptor, while S2 is involved in the fusion of the viral

                                    membranes. As for the SARS-CoV-2, its spike protein exhibits significantly stronger

                                    in

                                    contact with individuals. Our goal is to implement our design on surgical masks,
                                    contact lenses,
                                    and
                                    even filtration devices so as to reduce the amount of viruses that would come in

                                    human bodies and, thus, reduce the possibility of infection. In order to achieve our
                                    goals, iGem NYMU
                                    2020
                                    engineered a protein construct that includes the hACE2 receptor binding domain, a
                                    linker, and a
                                    protease
                                    that is specific at cleaving spike proteins. The protein construct functions as a
                                    capture device
                                    and
                                    can
                                    be implemented on many occasions as a mean to capture, destroy, and even quantify
                                    the amount of
                                    virus
                                    particles on a particular surface. We also consulted for some advice on material
                                    science and
                                    developed a
                                    special gel that has our protein construct attached to its surface, which could
                                    readily function
                                    as
                                    a
                                    capture device. Our main goal is to make a modular device that can be built upon or
                                    used for
                                    many

                                    Inspired by how Taiwan significantly reduced the number of COVID-19 infections by
                                    strictly
                                    imposing
                                    social distancing rules and requiring people to wear surgical masks. We figured that
                                    other than
                                    developing cures such as antibodies or other medications for people that are
                                    infected,

                                    Just like the saying goes, “an ounce of
                                    prevention is
                                    worth a
                                    pound of cure”. If we can successfully cut down on the exposure of humans to the
                                    virus, the
                                    infection
                                    rate could be significantly reduced and many social distancing regulations and city
                                    lockdowns
                                    can be
                                    relaxed so as to revive the already dwindling economy. Moreover, viruses have to
                                    infect host
                                    organisms
                                    in order to continue their reproduction. If we can reduce the number of infections
                                    to a low
                                    enough
                                    level, it is very likely that the virus will slow down its mutating process and even
                                    disappear
                                    itself as
                                    it fails to find the next host. Last but not least, we hope to impact the world with
                                    our novel
                                    idea
