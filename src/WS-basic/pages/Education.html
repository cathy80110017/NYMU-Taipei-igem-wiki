                                    It is a pleasure that our team collaborated with NCKU and launched a public
                                    education initiative. The reason why we held this event with NCKU is due to the fact
                                    that both of our topics are related to contact lenses coincidentally. Not only did
                                    we make posters but we also promoted this event on social networks to spread our
                                    influence via the internet (the photo on the right is a snapshot of our facebook
                                    page event). What we disseminated includes the correct way to recycle
                                    contact lenses and the severity of plastic particles pollution in the ocean. In the
                                    end of our event, we asked the participants to transform the contact lenses we
                                    collected into creative artifacts. One of our work was the iGEM logo, showing that
                                    we are taking part in this competition.

                            shoe lying under the ocean, implying that plastic contact lenses that we throw away
                            carelessly to sinks or toilets will return the consequences to ourselves eventually,
                            just like the high-heeled glass shoe in the story of Cinderella, knowing that
                            plastic particles we emit to the sea will wreak havoc on public health through
                            ecological circulation. In the end, the third artifact, which is a clock, reminds us
                            to reexamine ourselves and steer human civilization to pave the way for the greater

                                    educational institutes did not go smoothly on the grounds that they thought it would
                                    not be a wise decision to invoke large social gatherings when COVID-19 is still
