                        Our design idea is to capture and denature the SARS-CoV-2 using our customized protein. We chose
                        the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the
                        capturer of SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein on the surface of the virus could bind with hACE2(RBD)
                        and enter host cells via this mechanism. Moreover, we attached a protease to the bottom of the
                        hACE2(RBD) to denature the spike proteins captured. By doing so, we could not only create an
                        effective protective surface against SARS-CoV-2 but also deactivate the virus we captured
                        simultaneously. The following paragraph will get into more detail about the procedures of our
                        experiment.

                        It has been proven that the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind
                        to the cell receptor ACE2 when infecting human beings(see figure below). By utilizing this fact,
                        we design our device to capture SARS-CoV-2 by hACE2 when the virus passes our device. To be more
                        specific, we put hACE2 on gel made by us for detection, and we connect hACE2 and pepP together
                        for inactivation.

                        We designed a tiny box which can detect if there is SARS-CoV-2 in the userâ€™s breathe. Inside the
                        box, there is a piece of gel with hACE2. We add His tag on hACE2 so that His tag on hACE2 can
                        chelate with Co2+; therefore, can be presented on the surface of our gel with Co2+. Meanwhile,
                        we add red fluorescent protein(RFP) to hACE2 construct in order to show if one has SARS-CoV-2.
                        Firstly, we would let the user blow in our device. After one blowing in our device, the gel with
                        hACE2 would capture spike protein as mentioned above, if any, and then we use wash buffer to
                        wash off hACE2 without spike. Lastly, only hACE2 with spike would be left on the gel, and RFP
                        would show if one is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and attain detection.

                        We want to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 by preventing the virus from entering our cell. To achieve this
                        goal, we came up with an idea which is using a protease to cut spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
                        Research indicated that pepP could be the appropriate protease, so we add pepP to hACE2
                        construct. In ideal situation, pepP would cut spike which is captured by hACE2, and thus make
                        the virus unable to infect us.
