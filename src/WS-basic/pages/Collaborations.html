                                    We did collaborations with multiple IGEM teams. One of the ways of our
                                    collaborations was through a meetup, and due to pandemic reasons, we arranged an
                                    online meetup instead. During our meetup with Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU),
                                    both teams gave concise introductions on each other’s research topic and research
                                    designs. After the introductions, each team would then ask questions and give
                                    feedback to the other team letting each team see their own research from an outside
                                    perspective, letting each other find problems or details that could be improved on.
                                    For our team, we received feedback regarding the safety issues on our product
                                    applications, on the other hand we gave team CSMU feedback on their research
                                    methods. Through this discussion, both teams were able to change and improve
                                    research methods accordingly. We also discussed about additional collaborations for
                                    human practice, including becoming a part of the “I’ve gotta PHD” project where
                                    multiple IGEM teams collaborate to write on issues related to their research topics.

                                    Another online meetup we had was with the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)
                                    IGEM team. In this meeting, we also went with giving introductions first then
                                    receive feedback then discuss additional collaboration. During the introductions
                                    of each team’s research topic, we realized that both our teams wanted to apply
                                    our research on contact lens, and thus opened up a path for further
                                    collaboration between us teams. Through this meeting, we set up plans for
                                    collaborations between human practice and also gave each other valuable feedback
                                    regarding each of our research topics. We later assessed the feedback and
                                    changed some of our research methods accordingly. We also gave suggestions and
                                    opinions on team NCKU’s research details.

                                    In order to make sure the validity of our experiment result, we invited Taiwan’s
                                    National Chung Cheng University (CCU) to repeat our PCR experiment. The material
                                    we provided was a plasmid containing hACE2 and a pair of primer to make linear
                                    hACE2 fragment. The major difference between NYMU taipei and CCU’s experiment
                                    was the choice of PCR enzyme.

                                    On one hand, our original experiment uses KOD
                                    polymerase to amplify our target gene. On the other hand, CCU uses GoTaq
                                    polymerase in their PCR experiment. In comparison to GoTaq, KOD has a better
                                    thermostability and proofreading accuracy(which is even better than pfu
                                    polymerase family). Nevertheless, the disadvantage of this enzyme is that it
                                    requires strict environmnet to polymerize, making it sensitive to ion
                                    concentration shift and contamination. These factors mades it hard for us to
                                    find out the right condition. In a nutshell, the reason why we choose KOD is to
                                    reduce possible mutation which could cause serious protein mulfunction in our
                                    product.
                                    The Electrophoresis result to the top right is taken by the CCU iGem team.
                                    Although DNA smear could be seen in the background, the major band is on our
                                    expected position(roughly 2200bp). This result indicates that our design is
                                    representable and correct. Besides collaboration for the wet lab experiment. We
                                    also consulted CCU for some advice on protein-protein docking. Since NCCU had
                                    mass computational power to make use of Rosetta. We asked for some help and
                                    provided them with our protein data structures and experimental conditions so
                                    that they could conduct protein-protein docking with our provided protein
                                    structures so as to verify our result. Since they modeled our protein-protein
                                    docking using the ab-initio approach and our protein size is way too big for the
                                    method to be accurate in terms of prediction. Therefore, the results were
                                    somewhat far from our expectations. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the collaborating
                                    process and how we can exchange knowledge and experience via this manner.
