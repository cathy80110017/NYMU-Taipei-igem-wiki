                                As scientists, we make advancements in research through understanding works of other
                                scientists combined with our own research experience. The road to uncovering the
                                unknown is not easy and sometimes good results in the lab don’t connect so well in
                                the world outside. In order to let our research successfully connect with the real
                                world, Integrated Human Practices is an important part of achieving this goal. How
                                things are done include consulting experts, understanding corporate goals, and
                                collecting field surveys. Constant interaction and communication between in and
                                outside of the lab can find problems quickly and is also why we see feedback as such
                                precious knowledge. It is because of this group design and group thinking that from
                                design to end product, our team was able to keep things close to human needs.

                                People’s ideas and opinions can show us what is most needed amidst this pandemic. At the
                                very start of our project, our team decided on a set of questions related with COVID-19
                                to ask the masses. Outside of a lab environment, what would the common people consider
                                to be important in the timing of a pandemic? We asked some people about their thoughts.

                                The question is, “Amidst the situation of epidemic prevention, please stick the sticker
                                on the item you would be willing to abandon.” Products include alcohol hand sanitizer,
                                rapid test kits, toilet paper, drugs, vaccine, alcohol, face masks, and goggles.

                                                        infection of the virus, so to lower the chance of infection,
                                                        using personal protection equipment (PPE) is of upmost

                                                        PPE. The purpose of PPE is to protect the workers in the

                                                        In designing experiments using FRET (fluorescence resonance
                                                        energy transfer), our team met an obstacle that was hard to
                                                        overcome. To solve the problem, we went to ask for advice from
                                                        professor Kung of NYMU since he has done research related with
                                                        FRET. In the end we have gotten much valuable advice for how we
                                                        should choose our fluorescent proteins and how we should design
                                                        our linker proteins. Since the interactions of different factors
                                                        were extremely complicated when facing biochemical experiments.
                                                        We needed valuable advice on everything from experienced ones
                                                        who have conducted similar experiments. Professor Kung's advice
                                                        and experience proved extremely important for us as we avoided
                                                        many steps of trial and error.

                                                        In our experiments we found out that the spike proteins made

                                                        The first company we visited is a face mask company located in
                                                        Changhua county, the company’s name is called “MOTEX”. We were
                                                        able to have an interview with Chairman Zheng. During the visit,
                                                        we learned about how face masks were made and also the current
                                                        situation of face masks in the market is demand much more than
                                                        supply.
                                                        For face mask research, the company told us that they have been
                                                        designing a chip on the face mask that can detect virus
                                                        presence. Another research in development is a layer of silver
                                                        ions to be put on the face masks to kill bacteria but the time
                                                        needed for this to happen takes more than an hour to finish.
                                                        Lastly, our team also shared our views and ideas of adding
                                                        biologically designed protein on face masks to the company. The
                                                        company told us that if technical difficulties in this design
                                                        could be overcome, then this idea could possibly work. Most
                                                        importantly the company gave us face masks, this helped us on
                                                        the process of product application.

                                                        For the application of contact lens, the company we got in touch
                                                        with is called “Pegavision”. The company shared with us

                                                        researcher should notice when designing contact lens. Our team
                                                        learned a lot and was able to share our ideas on applications
                                                        for contact lens with the company.
                                                        The company gave us a lot of advice on our research, such as
                                                        what materials to choose, problems we might face on the way…etc.
                                                        Most importantly, the company also gave us contact lens we could
                                                        use for our research(including dry and wet lens), lending us a

                                        people keep rising every day. Our team believes that when humans are faced with

                                        problem, we should follow the scientific way of thinking and try to solve the
                                        problem. Therefore our team decided to walk out the laboratory and go to the
                                        streets
                                        to discuss this topic with people, we also went to a hospital to interview a

                                        working in the frontlines to get some feedback.

                                        The results of our survey indicate that the masses are most concerned about
                                        finding the right drug treatment for COVID-19, next on the list is alcohol, face
                                        masks, and then research on rapid test kits. We then incorporated and considered

                                    Through our discussions with Doctor Chan and the people from
                                    the
                                    survey, our team decided on a final idea of using our product on protective
                                    equipment. Also, through our discussions with people from the survey, we learned
                                    that in order for the masses to accept our product, our product should be convenient
                                    but also be able to increase protection against infection. Lastly, our final
                                    decision is to use our product on contact lens and face masks. Contact lens will be
                                    a form of hidden protection while face masks will prevent indirect infection. In
                                    conclusion, our research topic and application were born.</p>

                                        After confirming the path of our research topic, to carry out our idea in real
                                        life, our team brainstormed and found a lot of references to make our initial
                                        research design. Among this process, our team discussed with a lot of experts in
                                        different fields. We found both problems and solutions in different parts of our
                                        research and was able to correct our research on the way.

                                        Prof. Kung gave advice in the area of the linker for FRET. He suggested that we
                                        use a linker with a smaller molecular weight than originally designed, he also
                                        discussed with us how the length of the linker would affect the experiment. It
                                        is because of prof. Kung’s advice that our team was able to have more variety in
                                        the design and selection of the linker.

                                        The discussion with prof. Liu really made a big impact on our design. Through
                                        understanding our problem from a chemical engineering perspective, we were able
                                        to break out of our original design and combine knowledge from different
                                        backgrounds to make the contact lens material we needed.

                                        explanations of experiments, CEO Ma was willing to help out in our team’s

                                        The main purpose of company visits is to understand how a complete product
                                        should look like and make sure there is a need in the market for the
                                        product. In the communication and interactions with the companies, we
                                        learned about how their products were made which also gave us inspiration in
                                        our own product designs. On the other hand, the companies were also able to
                                        gain a different type of inspiration from us, for example: feedback on
                                        issues related with company responsibility to the public, strong passion for
                                        research… etc. The following content is about the two companies we had the

                                            some technical difficulties, the company still encouraged us to research on.
                                            They were also willing to give us face masks as support of our research.

                                            Not only were we able to discuss about product related technology and market
                                            situations, we were also able to talk about the hardships of consumer and
                                            business responsibility when products are out in the market. This gave us
