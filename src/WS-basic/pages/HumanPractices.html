                                    As a scientist, we make advancements in research through understanding works of
                                    other scientists combined with our own research experience. The road to uncovering
                                    the unknown is not easy and sometimes good results in the lab don’t connect so well
                                    in the world outside. In order to let our research successfully connect with the
                                    real world, Integrated Human Practices is an important part of achieving this goal.
                                    How things are done include consulting experts, understanding corporate goals, and
                                    collecting field surveys. Constant interaction and communication between in and
                                    outside of the lab can find problems quickly and is also why we see feedback as such
                                    precious knowledge. It is because of this group design and group thinking that from
                                    design to end product, our team was able to keep things close to human needs.

                                    pandemic. At the very start of our project, our team decided on a set of questions
                                    related with COVID-19 to ask the masses. Outside of a lab environment, what would
                                    the common people consider to be important in the timing of a pandemic? We asked
                                    some people about their thoughts.
                                    The question is: Amidst the situation of epidemic prevention, please stick the
                                    sticker on the item you would be willing to abandon. Products include alcohol hand

                                        problem, we should follow the scientific way of thinking and try to solve the

                                        to discuss this topic with people, we also went to a hospital to interview a

                                    Through our discussions with Doctor Chan and the people from
                                    the
                                    survey, our team decided on a final idea of using our product on protective
                                    equipment. Also, through our discussions with people from the survey, we learned
                                    that in order for the masses to accept our product, our product should be convenient
                                    but also be able to increase protection against infection. Lastly, our final
                                    decision is to use our product on contact lens and face masks. Contact lens will be
                                    a form of hidden protection while face masks will prevent indirect infection. In
                                    conclusion, our research topic and application were born.</p>

                                        After confirming the path of our research topic, to carry out our idea in real
                                        life, our team brainstormed and found a lot of references to make our initial
                                        research design. Among this process, our team discussed with a lot of experts in
                                        different fields. We found both problems and solutions in different parts of our
                                        research and was able to correct our research on the way.

                                        Prof. Kung gave advice in the area of the linker for FRET. He suggested that we
                                        use a linker with a smaller molecular weight than originally designed, he also
                                        discussed with us how the length of the linker would affect the experiment. It
                                        is because of prof. Kung’s advice that our team was able to have more variety in
                                        the design and selection of the linker.

                                        The discussion with prof. Liu really made a big impact on our design. Through
                                        understanding our problem from a chemical engineering perspective, we were able
                                        to break out of our original design and combine knowledge from different
                                        backgrounds to make the contact lens material we needed.

                                        ACE2 and spike protein in a normal lab. After exchange of knowledge and
                                        explanations of experiments, CEO Ma was willing to help out in our team’s

                                        The main purpose of company visits is to understand how a complete product
                                        should look like and make sure there is a need in the market for the
                                        product. In the communication and interactions with the companies, we
                                        learned about how their products were made which also gave us inspiration in
                                        our own product designs. On the other hand, the companies were also able to
                                        gain a different type of inspiration from us, for example: feedback on
                                        issues related with company responsibility to the public, strong passion for
                                        research… etc. The following content is about the two companies we had the

                                            examples of adding material on face masks so even though our team may face
                                            some technical difficulties, the company still encouraged us to research on.
                                            They were also willing to give us face masks as support of our research.

                                            situations, we were also able to talk about the hardships of consumer and
                                            business responsibility when products are out in the market. This gave us
                                            more insight on why the transition of products from in the lab to the real
                                            world isn’t something easy. In the end the company gave us a lot of
