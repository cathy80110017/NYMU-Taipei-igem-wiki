                                        We design the mask to prevent the virus attached to the mask from falling off

                                        by the virus being scattered in the air.
                                        Target population: We believe that this product is suitable for people around
                                        the world who want to increase protection in this epidemic.
                                        Usage: We design a mask whch we need to insert gel on the corresponding site
                                        when using.

                                        With fast and costless detection tools, we can effectively
                                        decrease the incidence of virus infection.
                                        Target group: Customs is an important place for epidemic prevention. We hope
                                        that people who enter and leave the country can be screened quickly.
                                        How to use: After the breathe is blown into the test box from the mouth by
                                        compression of the lung cavity, add the extra rfp-ACE2 liquid into the box and
                                        mixed with the solution evenly (this step takes about 1 minute), after mixing,
                                        pour the rfp-ACE2 liquid into Waste liquid layer, at this time, open the wash
                                        buffer box to rinse (this step takes about 5 minutes), and then flow the wash
                                        buffer into the waste liquid layer. And finally we could see whether there is
                                        any color on the glue. A red dot indicates that the individual has high
                                        possibility of carrying virus. If there is no color on the glue, it means the
                                        individual has low possibility of carrying virus.
