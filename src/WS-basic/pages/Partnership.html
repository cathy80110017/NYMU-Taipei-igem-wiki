                Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) guidelines proposed by the UN suggest 17 goals in total, concerning
                poverty, health care, climate change and so on issues. These plans were hoped to be fulfilled by 2030.
                Through social media, we can easily learn the information toward SDGs. The Internet, fully accessible to
                everyone, is also a great approach. Means to meet SDGs goals appears world widely on the Internet. As we
                type the keywords on the searching bar, numerous excellent examples will show up immediately.
                Nevertheless, after learning the concepts of SDGs, we wholeheartedly believe that we should spare no
                effort to dedicate our strength, too. Considering to take actions in person, we started to figure out
                our own solutions.

                        As we defined COVID-19 issues as our team project, we brainstormed for the way to meet the SDG
                        guidelines. According to one of our applications, we practiced our ideas on contact lens,
                        fortunately, which is also the same application target as iGEM NCKU’s. Consequently, we sought
                        to have corporations on tackling contact lens issues together. How the contact lens been
                        recycled and be reusable may be the major issue, which is our final solution.

                Nowadays, as more and more individuals taking contact lens as their daily life necessity, the waste of
                this tiny, transparent stuff increases enormously. Nonetheless, parts of contact lens users have limited
                knowledge to throw contact lenses away properly. The main problem is mostly due to a lack of public
                conscious about how to deal with unwanted contact lens waste. A study from US had manifested that about
                15-20% of contact lens users just throw the contact lenses to sinks or flush in to the toilet directly.
                On the other words, by this way, those contact lenses may degrade into microplastics, which severely
                causes water pollution. Lives can be threatened seriously in this case. The wrong disposal methods of
                contact lenses may have great influence on Earth, which may harm environment tremendously, especially
                for marine life.

                Although having Asian faces, the Chinese are still human beings!
                – the phenomenon of discrimination against the Chinese during COVID-19 pandemic
            </p>
            <p class="indent mb-0">
                Through ages, racial discrimination is consistently a significant issue. Even nowadays, more or less,
                violent debates between colors still exist as before in modern era. Until now, there is still no
                appropriate solution to this issue, no matter how fancy the world is. To make matters worse, due to the
                eruption of COVID-19, the problem has become more and more serious recently especially for Chinese
                people, which then results in social contradictions under the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p class="indent mb-0">
                Currently, COVID-19 have already taken over million lives globally. In the beginning, the virus was
                found in Wuhan, China. It, however, has become a worldwide disaster in a short term. The president of
                the United States, Donald Trump even called SARS-CoV-2 a “Chinese virus”. In the meantime, particularly
                in Western areas, the Chinese become obvious targets. In other words, the status of being Chinese put
                them at a risk of discrimination, which then contributes to incredible impact on their lives.
            </p>
            <p class="indent mb-0">
                According to Huma Right Watch (HWR), report on 17.04.2020 revealed that in just a few months, over 1000
                cases of discrimination against the Chinese had been recorded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
                also delivered a warning that, during the pandemic, crime rates concerning assault on Chinese people may
                elevate rapidly. Those who assaulted Chinese people claim that individuals with yellow skin are virus
                transmitters and that since Chinese could carry the virus, they should all leave the western country.
                Some even go as far as to say that the Chinese should not have the same rights to live a normal life.
                Under these situations, an unspoken rule that is followed in those precarious areas is, “Individuals,
                who look like Chinese, should be attacked.”
            </p>
            <p class="indent mb-0">
                The discrimination not only manifests in physical aggression but also verbal form, which is also the
                more common way. Examples include swearing and demands to leave shops. Among the discriminated, women
                are even more often the subjects of this kind of treatment. Given these situations, Chinese are often
                unwelcomed in many places. Just because of their ethnic backgrounds, hotels and even Uber drivers would
                reject services to the Chinese. A radio program in Holland even aired the track, “Voorkomen is beter dan
                Chinezen”, appealing the public masses to keep distance to the Chinese. In addition, face masks itself
                is already a hot topic, but to make matters worse, this topic is also commonly used in discrimination
                among Chinese people. Chinese People with masks will be assumed as infected while the ones without mask
                will be assumed as being careless virus transmitters.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Being stigmatized as virus transmitters, the Chinese, due to fear of being attacked even further,
                advocate for change. They have established a team called “Asian Gambling SOS” which aims to make
                connections between communities closer and stronger. Moreover, Jason Chu, an American-Born Chinese,
                wrote a rap song declaring that the Chinese living in western areas are not terrorist. They are just
                people who live there and that those places may be their ‘only’ home. It is just so ignorant and
                ridiculous to discriminate directly against all Chinese people. In conclusion, although having Asia
                faces, the Chinese are still human beings.
