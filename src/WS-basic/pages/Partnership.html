                The main purpose of company visits is to understand how a complete product should look like and make
                sure there is a need in the market for the product. In the communication and interactions with the
                companies, we learned about how their products were made which also gave us inspiration in our own
                product designs. On the other hand, the companies were also able to gain a different type of inspiration
                from us, for example: feedback on issues related with company responsibility to the public, strong
                passion for research… etc. The following content is about the two companies we had the honor to visit.

                        One of the brilliant examples to greatly embodies this concept is to let individuals having
                        their own personal experience, which may make deeper impression on themselves. We put emphasis
                        on the problem by encouraging them to make their own art crafts, which participants can display
                        their creativity by giving imagination with contact lens as the material, delivering another
                        value of contact lens waste. Works on that day were totally amazing, which we hadn’t seen

                I’ve gotta PHD is a collaboration project with over 10 iGEM teams, hosted mainly by iGEM CSMU and iGEM
                NCKU teams, focusing on 7 topics, including Science Communication, Basic Health Care, Mental Health,
                Break Discrimination and Racism, Research, Health care Orginization, Policies. Owing to our dedications
                on COVID-19 issue, it cannot denied that the significant impacts of COVID-19 over the world. Besides
                focusing on lab efforts, our team also put emphasis on humanities issues. We found that the Chinese over
                the world, especially in western area, have been discriminated critically. This terrible situation even
                worsed during COVID-19 period. Conquently, we would like to present the phenomenon through this platform
                to public concerning the topic of Break Discrimination and Racism.

                Break Discrimination and Racism: Although having Asia faces, the Chinese are still human
                beings! - The phenomenon of discrimination against the Chinese
                during COVID-19 pandemic
            </h5>
            <p class="indent">
                Through the ages, racial discrimination is consistently a significant issue. Even nowadays, more or
                less, violent debates between colors still exist as before in modern era. Until now, there is still no
                appropriate solution to this issue, no matter how fancy the world is. To make matters worse, due to the
                eruption of COVID-19, the problem has become more and more serious recently especially for Chinese
                people, which then results in social contradictions under the pandemic.
                Currently, COVID-19 have already taken over million lives globally. In the beginning, the virus was
                found in Wuhan, China. It, however, has become a worldwide disaster in a short term. The president of
                the United States, Donald Trump even called SARS-CoV-2 a ‘Chinese virus’. In the meantime, particularly
                in Western areas, the Chinese become obvious targets. In other words, the status of being Chinese put
                them at a risk of discrimination, which then contributes to incredible impact on their lives.
                According to Huma Right Watch (HWR), report on 17.04.2020 revealed that in just a few months, over 1000
                cases of discrimination against the Chinese had been recorded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
                also delivered a warning that, during the pandemic, crime rates concerning assault on Chinese people may
                elevate rapidly. Those who assaulted Chinese people claim that individuals with yellow skin are virus
                transmitters and that since Chinese could carry the virus, they should all leave the western country.
                Some even go as far as to say that the Chinese should not have the same rights to live a normal life.
                Under these situations, an unspoken rule that is followed in those precarious areas is: ‘Individuals,
                who look like Chinese, should be attacked.’
                The discrimination not only manifests in physical aggression but also verbal form, which is also the
                more common way. Examples include swearing and demands to leave shops. Among the discriminated, women
                are even more often the subjects of this kind of treatment. Given these situations, Chinese are often
                unwelcomed in many places. Just because of their ethnic backgrounds, hotels and even Uber drivers would
                reject services to the Chinese. A radio program in Holland even aired the track: ‘Voorkomen is beter dan
                Chinezen’, appealing the public masses to keep distance to the Chinese. In addition, face masks itself
                is already a hot topic, but to make matters worse, this topic is also commonly used in discrimination
                among Chinese people. Chinese People with masks will be assumed as infected while the ones without mask
                will be assumed as being careless virus transmitters.
                Being stigmatized as virus transmitters, the Chinese, due to fear of being attacked even further,
                advocate for change. They have established a team called ‘Asian Gambling SOS’ which aims to make
                connections between communities closer and stronger. Moreover, Jason Chu, an American-Born Chinese,
                wrote a rap song declaring that the Chinese living in western areas are not terrorist. They are just
                people who live there and that those places may be their ‘only’ home. It is just so ignorant and
                ridiculous to discriminate directly against all Chinese people. In conclusion, although having Asia
                faces, the Chinese are still human beings.
