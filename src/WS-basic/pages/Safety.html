                            Safety has always been our top priority. Since we has been working with genetically modified
                            organisms and chemicals, we are responsible for ensuring the safety of both the environment
                            and humans.

                            We used DH5-alpha, K-12, and BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli, which all belong to BSL-1
                            organisms. They are E.coli strains that poses little or no risk of pathogenicity.

                            Our lab is classified as biosafety level one (BSL 1) lab, which means that there is minimal
                            risk for the humans and the environment. At BSL 1 labs, normal laboratory personal
                            protective equipment is generally worn, including a lab coat, gloves, eye protectin goggles.
                            Besides, long hairs should be tied; long pants and closed shoes should be worn. Before and
                            after entering the lab, it is necessary to wash our hands thoroughly.
                            Our lab is equipped with emergency equipments, such as emergency eyewash, emergency shower,
                            and fire extinguisher.
